abstract: "There are about one billion persons with disabilities (PWDs) in the world. Between 40 and 80 million of them are in India. In 2015, the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan (Accessible India Campaign), a \"nation-wide Campaign for achieving universal accessibility for PWDs\". One of its three components, \"Information and Communication Eco-System Accessibility\", focuses on accessible softwares and digital artifacts. The private industry is also increasingly emphasizing developing softwares that are accessible to everyone. However, the CS curricula that ought to prepare the future professionals to develop such accessible softwares hardly cover topics related to accessibility. This project is aimed at understanding the status of accessibility education in India and developing appropriate course content. I present initial ideas, solicit feedback, and invite collaborators through the discussion on this poster."
