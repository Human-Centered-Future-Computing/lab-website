abstract: "Despite a growing emphasis on accessible software, these topics find little mention in computing curricula. Less than 5 percent of our students mentioned disabilities when asked to list concerns in designing an app, although other inclusivity considerations were relatively common. We present the preliminary findings of our questionnaire and details of our interventions to teach accessibility in an Android-focussed Software Engineering course in this poster.."
