Sravan Danda is an Assistant Professor at Computer Science and Informations Systems (CSIS) at BITS-Pilani, Goa from September 2020. Prior to joining BITS-Pilani, Goa, he was a visitor at Systems Science and Informatics Unit (SSIU), Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Bangalore from October 2019. During this period, he worked on developing algorithms for hyperspectral band selection using Mathematical Morphology (MM), a sub-area of Image Processing. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the same lab, SSIU, ISI-Bangalore in October 2019. In his PhD thesis, he established that, faster and efficient algorithms for image segmentation and filtering can be obtained by exploiting the contrast-invariance nature of its solutions. This was done by using power watershed framework from MM. Before joining the PhD program in 2013, he worked as a Business Analyst at Genpact, Retail Chain Analytics domain, Bangalore from October 2011 - September 2013. At Genpact, he was responsible for providing recommendations such as product pricing and stocking based on the behaviour of shoppers, backed up with statistical analyses on point-of-sale data. Prior to this, he received his B.Math.(Hons.) degree in Mathematics and M.Stat. degree in Mathematical Statistics and Probability from ISI, in 2009 and 2011 respectively.
