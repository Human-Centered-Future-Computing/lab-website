Our initial work under the [Sugamyata](//swaroopjoshi.in/project/sugamyata/) project, on integrating accessibility in computing education in India was recently presented at top conferences in the field (See links under *Related* below.):

* [Inclusive Thinking Questionnaire: Preliminary Results](/publication/sigcse22/), ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium 2022 (*Core-A*)
* [Teaching Accessibility in India: A Work in Progress](/publication/icer2021/), ACM ICER 2021

ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium is one of the oldest conferences on computing education; it is ranked Core-A. ACM ICER is a relatively new, but highly renowned venue in computing education research.
