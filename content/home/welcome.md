The nature of computing is evolving rapidly.
Individuals use a variety of devices in diverse ways for diverse operations (smart phones, watches, voice commands to smart homes, etc.), unlike the typical keyboard-mouse-and-screen interactions.
These smart devices can collect inputs in novel ways (e.g., heartrate) and provide feedback (e.g., vibrations) in subtle ways.
They can also gather a huge amount of data that can be analysed to learn a lot about the user's behavior.
There is a tremendous scope for research in developing devices, apps, and algorithms in that make use of these futuristic technologies that can directly impact the lives of millions.

The **Human-Centered Future Computing Lab** at [BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa campus](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) is leading the R&D initiatives in futuristic topics such as:

- preventive healthcare
- accessible technology for all
- ad-hoc disaster management
- precision agriculture
