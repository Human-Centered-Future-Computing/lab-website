summary: 8th Workshop on Sensing Systems and Applications Using Wrist Worn Smart Devices (WristSense), co-located with IEEE PerCom, March 21-25, 2022.
abstract: "The main goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to share innovative ideas, discuss challenges, and brainstorm potential solutions to open research problems related to the domain of wrist-worn smart devices. Using sensors, computation resources, and communication interfaces available on smartwatches and smart bands, it is possible to capture information about the device user, perform computation to infer the user’s activities and their context, and communicate these to a smartphone or the cloud. These wrist-worn smart devices represent a perfect platform to conduct research on human activity and behavior. They introduce opportunities for exploring new research problems, such as efficient classification and computation on the wearable device, offloading of computation from the user’s watch to the phone or the cloud, enhancement of user experience, smart notification management, physical activity sensing, behavior modeling, and data analysis."

<!-- Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
